# TwitterBotExample
Example code given for the CeWiT Ethical AI Bot Workshop


The Python code for this repository was taken from the Twitter example documents and altered slightly.

Requirements for this exercise:
– A Twitter Developers account, with the associated API Key and API Key Secret, Access Token and Access Token Secret, and Bearer Token. 
– An IDE that can run Python (I prefer VS Code)
- 

Libraries needed: 
– requests_oauthlib : This library is available for download through pip3, which you should have if you've worked with Python.
